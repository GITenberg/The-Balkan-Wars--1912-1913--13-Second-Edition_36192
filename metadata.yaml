description: The Balkan League (Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria) first conquered
  Ottoman-held Macedonia and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of
  the spoils. Tensions among the Balkan states over their rival aspirations to the
  provinces of Ottoman-occupied Roumelia, namely Eastern Roumelia, Thrace and Macedonia,
  subsided somewhat following intervention by the Great Powers in the mid-19th century,
  aimed at securing both fuller protection for the provinces' Christian majority and
  protection of the status quo. By 1867 Greece, Serbia and Montenegro have all secured
  their independence.
